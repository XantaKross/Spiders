- Ever wanted to complete all your NPTEL courses but dang it, your network doesn't connect coz unfortunately
the wifi gods have forsaken you?
- Ever been annoyed by spotify ads? (No, I'm not going to ask you to buy premium)

Here's my solution to both.

Python - 3.10.12 used.

Introducing: Project Spider (Tada!)
Basically, this is going to be my open-source repo for what I call my pet "spiders" or in otherwords. Scripts that
crawl the web. Download in bulk and let me (and you too) have what we want. I'll add new scripts as I face new issues.



For deploying each script take a look at the README.txt files within each folder.


NOTE: This project is a extension of Sanctuary which is my decentralised virtual system.

echo "# Spider-Songs" >> README.md
git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/XantaKross/Spider-Songs.git
git push -u origin main
