- Ever wanted to complete all your NPTEL courses but dang it, your network doesn't connect coz unfortunately
the wifi gods have forsaken you?
- Ever been annoyed by spotify ads? (No, I'm not going to ask you to buy premium)

Here's my solution to both.

Python - 3.10.12 used.

Introducing: Project Spiders (Tada!)
Basically, this is going to be my open-source repo for what I call my pet "spiders" or in otherwords scripts that
crawl the web. Download in bulk and let me (and you too) have what we want. I'll add new scripts as I face new issues and needs.

For deploying each script take a look at the README.txt files within each folder.






NOTE: This project is a extension of Sanctuary which is my decentralised virtual system.
